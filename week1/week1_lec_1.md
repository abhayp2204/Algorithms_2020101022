There are 4 steps to solving a problem:
1. understand the computational problem.
2. Find an efficient solution.
3. See if you can do better.
4. If not, prove that we cannot do better.

A computational problem is a membership query language.

Axioms of Computation:
1. Machines are not omnipresent:
   It takes time to retrieve data.

2. Machines are not omniscient:
   Only finite information can be stored / recieved from finite volume.

3. Machines are not omnipotent:
4. A finite length code can only exert a finite amount of control.
